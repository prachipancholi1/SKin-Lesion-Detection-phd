# SKin-Lesion-Detection-phd

This project focuses on classifying skin lesion images into three categories: **psoriasis**, **eczema**, and **keratoses**. It utilizes both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches to achieve accurate classification.

## Overview

Skin diseases like psoriasis, eczema, and keratoses often exhibit similar visual characteristics, making accurate diagnosis challenging. This project aims to develop models that can distinguish between these conditions using image classification techniques.îˆ†

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [DermNet](https://dermnetnz.org/), a comprehensive online resource for skin conditions. Images are categorized into three classes:îˆ†

- **Psoriasis**
- **Eczema**
- **Keratoses**

The dataset is split into training and testing sets with varying ratios (70:30, 80:20, 90:10) to evaluate model performance under different conditions.îˆ†

## Notebooks

The repository contains several Jupyter notebooks that implement different models and data splits. Each notebook can be directly opened in Google Colab for interactive execution:îˆ†
